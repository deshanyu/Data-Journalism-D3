Find the data
Look for demographic information using the 2014 one-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. 

Format and Test the Data
Format the data for D3. With the two data types chosen, grab the value columns from each and paste them into a new Excel document. Create header names that can be easily called with JavaScript. 

Visualize the Data
Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Code this graphic in the app.js file â€” make sure to pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 

Embed into an iframe
When the d3.html displays the graphic just as you'd like it to, embed it in index.html with an iframe. Add a quick written analysis of your data below the graphic.

Technologies used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript and D3.js.
